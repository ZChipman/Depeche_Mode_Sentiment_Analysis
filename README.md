# Depeche_Mode_Sentiment_Analysis

## Background
This started out as the final project for Scripting for Data Analysis course at Syracuse University. In the original project, I anlyzed the discography of the band “Depeche Mode” using Python’s sentiment analysis tools. The lyrics of their 14 studio albums were scraped from the web using the BeautifulSoup module.
