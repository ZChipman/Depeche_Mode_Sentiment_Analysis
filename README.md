# Depeche_Mode_Sentiment_Analysis

## Background
This started out as the final project for Scripting for Data Analysis course at Syracuse University. In the original project, I anlyzed the discography of the band “Depeche Mode” using Python’s sentiment analysis tools. The lyrics of their 14 studio albums were scraped from the web using the BeautifulSoup module.

## Files:
Depeche_Mode_Sentiment_Analysis.docx: Written report for the original project.

Depeche_Mode_Sentiment_Analysis_Presentation.pptx: PowerPoint presentation for the original project.

Depeche_Mode_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb: The python code for the project. An python application such as Jupyter notebook will be required to view the code. 

## References:
Sources are listed at the end of the written report.

## Future Goals:

In March of 2023, Depeche Mode released their 15th studio album, "Memento Mori." I plan on adding this album to the project once the lyrics are uploaded onto lyrics.com.
